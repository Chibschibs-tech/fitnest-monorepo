## System Overview

The Fitnest.ma delivery system is designed to be **simple and flexible** to accommodate evolving logistics operations. Instead of complex scheduling algorithms, it focuses on showing customers exactly what they ordered and when, while giving admins full control over marking deliveries as completed.

### Core Principles
- **Customer-centric**: Show exactly what the customer selected during ordering
- **Logistics-flexible**: Adapt to any delivery pattern (daily, batched, etc.)
- **Simple tracking**: Binary status (pending → delivered)
- **Admin-controlled**: Manual marking of deliveries for maximum flexibility

### Key Features
- Display customer's exact selected days and weeks
- Simple delivery status tracking
- Bulk delivery marking for efficient operations
- Real-time status updates
- Flexible logistics accommodation

## Customer Order Flow

### Order Selection Process
When customers place an order, they select:

1. **Meal Plan Type**: Weight Loss, Muscle Gain, Keto, Stay Fit
2. **Meal Configuration**: Number of main meals, breakfasts, and snacks
3. **Delivery Days**: Specific days of the week (minimum 3 days)
4. **Duration**: Number of weeks (1, 2, or 4 weeks)
5. **Start Date**: When they want deliveries to begin

### Data Storage
The order data is stored with:
\`\`\`json
{
  "selected_days": ["monday", "wednesday", "friday"],
  "selected_weeks": 3,
  "start_date": "2024-01-15",
  "plan_name": "Weight Loss Plan"
}
\`\`\`

### Schedule Generation
The system generates delivery dates by:
1. Taking the customer's selected days
2. Calculating exact dates for each week of their subscription
3. Creating a delivery entry for each date
4. All deliveries start with "pending" status

---

## Delivery Schedule Generation

### Algorithm
\`\`\`typescript
// Example: Customer selects Mon, Wed, Fri for 3 weeks starting Jan 15, 2024
const selectedDays = ["monday", "wednesday", "friday"]
const selectedWeeks = 3
const startDate = new Date("2024-01-15")

const dayMapping = {
  monday: 1, tuesday: 2, wednesday: 3, thursday: 4,
  friday: 5, saturday: 6, sunday: 0
}

const deliveries = []
for (let week = 0; week < selectedWeeks; week++) {
  for (const dayName of selectedDays) {
    const dayOfWeek = dayMapping[dayName]
    const deliveryDate = new Date(startDate)
    
    // Calculate exact date for this day in this week
    const daysFromStart = week * 7 + ((dayOfWeek - startDate.getDay() + 7) % 7)
    deliveryDate.setDate(startDate.getDate() + daysFromStart)
    
    deliveries.push({
      scheduledDate: deliveryDate.toISOString(),
      dayName: dayName,
      weekNumber: week + 1,
      status: "pending"
    })
  }
}
\`\`\`

### Example Output
For Mon/Wed/Fri, 3 weeks starting Jan 15, 2024:
\`\`\`
Week 1: Jan 15 (Mon), Jan 17 (Wed), Jan 19 (Fri)
Week 2: Jan 22 (Mon), Jan 24 (Wed), Jan 26 (Fri)  
Week 3: Jan 29 (Mon), Jan 31 (Wed), Feb 2 (Fri)
\`\`\`

## Admin Delivery Management

### Admin Dashboard Features
- **View all pending deliveries** across all customers
- **Select multiple deliveries** for bulk operations
- **Mark deliveries as delivered** individually or in batches
- **Filter by date, customer, or plan type**
- **Track delivery statistics** (total, pending, completed)

### Flexible Delivery Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Daily Delivery
- Deliver meals fresh each day
- Mark each day individually as delivered

#### Scenario 2: Batch Delivery
- Deliver 2-3 days worth of meals at once
- Select multiple days and mark all as delivered simultaneously

#### Scenario 3: Weekly Delivery
- Deliver entire week's meals on one day
- Select all 5-7 days for that week and mark as delivered

### Admin Interface
\`\`\`typescript
// Admin can select multiple deliveries
const selectedDeliveries = [
  "28|2024-01-15", // Order 28, Jan 15
  "28|2024-01-17", // Order 28, Jan 17
  "29|2024-01-15"  // Order 29, Jan 15
]

// Mark all selected as delivered
await markDeliveriesAsDelivered(selectedDeliveries)

## Frontend Components

### Customer Dashboard Components

#### `ActiveSubscription.tsx`
- Shows subscription details and delivery progress
- Displays upcoming and past deliveries
- Handles pause/resume functionality

#### `SubscriptionManagementPage.tsx`
- Detailed view of specific subscription
- Full delivery schedule with status
- Subscription management actions

### Admin Components

#### `DeliveryManagementPage.tsx`
- Lists all deliveries with filtering
- Bulk selection and marking functionality
- Delivery statistics dashboard

### Key Features
\`\`\`typescript
// Customer view - shows their exact selections
const deliveries = [
  { date: "2024-01-15", day: "Monday", week: 1, status: "delivered" },
  { date: "2024-01-17", day: "Wednesday", week: 1, status: "pending" },
  { date: "2024-01-19", day: "Friday", week: 1, status: "pending" }
]

// Admin view - bulk operations
const handleMarkDelivered = async (selectedDeliveries) => {
  // Group by order ID for efficient processing
  const deliveriesByOrder = groupByOrderId(selectedDeliveries)
  
  // Mark each order's deliveries
  for (const [orderId, dates] of Object.entries(deliveriesByOrder)) {
    await markDeliveriesDelivered(orderId, dates)
  }
}
\`\`\`

---

## Business Logic

### Delivery Status Flow
\`\`\`
Order Created → Generate Delivery Dates → All Start as "Pending"
                                              ↓
Admin Marks as Delivered ← Flexible Delivery ← Customer Sees Schedule
\`\`\`

### Status Definitions
- **Pending**: Delivery scheduled but not yet completed
- **Delivered**: Meals have been delivered to customer
- **Skipped**: Delivery was intentionally skipped (e.g., customer request)

### Pause/Resume Logic
- **Pause**: Customer can pause subscription (72-hour notice required)
- **Resume**: Customer can resume with smart date calculation
- **Impact**: Paused days remain "pending" until resumed

### Flexible Logistics Support
The system supports any delivery pattern:

1. **Same-day delivery**: Mark today's delivery as delivered
2. **Batch delivery**: Mark multiple days at once
3. **Weekly prep**: Mark entire week when meals are prepared
4. **Custom patterns**: Any combination based on operational needs
